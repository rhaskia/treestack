# Treestack
"If you're over 25 and own a computer this language is a must-try!"
(Insert tree picture)
Treestack works essentially like a regular stack language, except each stack contains a stack of their own.
Treestack also allows for more movement around the stack/s than a Forth for example, and also allows for pointers to locations on the stack.

# Syntax
Syntax is derived of 3-4 main types: [operators](operators.md), 

# Ideas

https://hypercubed.github.io/joy/html/j01tut.html
group command
random command
better string handling ( seperate stack )
char pushing
{} for pushing commands as string
bool types
ast rotation ( split off into ast sections of string )
flattening
better mapping
filtering
escaped chars
join for joining two vecs (concant easy)

# Examples
roguelike generation
recursive functions 
mapping and filtering tests
